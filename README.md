# PBIDemos


Welcome to my PowerBI Demos repository.  I've tried to keep some concept of order amongst this chaos so hopefully you can find what you need!

Here's the folder structure:

|Folder|Files you'll find|
|------|------------------|
|[PBI with Cogntive Services](https://github.com/rosscouldrey/PBIDemos/tree/main/PBI%20with%20Cognitive%20Services)| PowerBI files that integrate with Azure Cognitive Services|
|[Report Design](https://github.com/rosscouldrey/PBIDemos/tree/main/Report%20Design)| Examples of Report Design Techniques|
